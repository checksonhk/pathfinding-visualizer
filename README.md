# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer is a project created to help me develop futher understanding into Graph Traversals and Data Structures. I decided to create a visuazlier as it helped me visualize and understand what the different pathfinding algorithms were doing.

## Live Demo

You can demo the app at: [http://jacksonto.me/pathfinding/](http://jacksonto.me/pathfinding/)

## Key Features

Currently I have implemented the following algorithms:

PathFinding:

- Depth First Search
- Breath First Search
- Greedy Best Search
- Djisktra
- A\*

Maze Algorithms:

- Pure Random
- Recursive Division

## TODO / Bug Fixes

- implement weights
- styling breaks on high resolution screens
- swarm pathfinding algorithm
- disable buttons when alogrithms are running
- auto clear grids when maze algorithms are selected
- recursive backtracking algorithm
- Randomized Kruskal's algorithm
- Randomized Prim's algorithm
- ability to stop animations
- implement cards to provide psuedocode for algorithms

## Getting Started

To clone and run this application, you'll need Git and Node.js (which comes with npm) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/checksonhk/pathfinding-visualizer

# Go into the repository
$ cd pathfinding-visualizer

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

  The original idea is from Clement, I thought it would be interesting for me to create my a new version of this idea, using currently technologies.
